    <p>Hi, I'm Ethan, and a few weeks ago I decided it was time to join the 
    world of the interwebs and make my own website. Given that this opportunity
    has been around for literally my entire life I'm only about 9727 days
    (or 26.6 years) late to the party.</p>

    <p>So, what can I say here? I'm a computer scientist currently working at
    Google on Cloud Security and I've been working there for 
    (2016/08/01 - currentDate = ) about a year and a month (note to self, add
    some fancy Javascript to this page). Before that I worked on my bachelors
    and masters degrees in compute science at Virginia Tech. During my masters
    I worked in the <a href="http://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/">Complex Networks
    and Security Research lab</a> on security issues in spectrum sharing, a new
    and more intuitive authentication scheme for augmented reality, and 
    training deep learning models with user data without revealing the user
    data to the entity training the model. Besides a degree I published a
    <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Wda_DQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA1&ots=VM5wzlAOe-">
    chapter in a book</a> on spectrum sharing and published a <a 
    href="http://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/publication/ccs-trusted-workshop-lgtm-paper.pdf">
    paper</a> on the augmented reality authentication scheme at the 6th
    International Workshop on Trustworthy Embeded Devices (TrustED) in 2016 in
    Vienna, Austria.</p>

    <p>When I'm not at work making the cloud more secure I'm usually reading
    books, listening to books on tape (I refuse to call them audiobooks...), 
    watching way too many shows, hiking, or reading papers on natural lanugage
    processing, machine learning, security, or privacy (which is usually
    negatively impacted by advances in the first two areas). I'll probably
    use this site as a dumping ground for content I consume to reference later
    and maybe at some point I'll connect a blog to it and write about the
    things that I overconsume. So at some point those links in the header will
    actually point to pages that aren't just empty.</p>

    <p>Oh hey, and I'll also slap the old resume/CV up here because maybe
    someone who wants to give me money will show up here too.</p>

    <p>Cheers!</p>
